<p>This is a 3D printable small drawer divider for the Akro-Mils 10164 parts cabinet.</p>

<p>The clear drawers themselves have a nice little slot for partitioning, so this divider fits right in and sits snugly without bowing out the drawer.</p>

<p>While there are several dividers that come attached to the back of the cabinet (which are manually de-paneled by the end consumer), they&rsquo;re very limited in quantity.</p>

<p>So if you have a 3D printer of some sort, or want to play with the model enough to make it &lsquo;go&rsquo; on a laser cutter/CNC, give this a shot.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this <strong><em>will not</em></strong> fit the larger drawers like on the 10144.</p>

<p>Download the STL file <a href="https://github.com/davidk/3D-Printable-Parts-Divider">here</a>.</p>

<p>To prevent ambiguities, the license for this (simple work) is WTFPL. Feel free to remix it, and do as you wish without reading walls of text.</p>

<p>A simple Bus Pirate v3 to AVR adapter. This was made to simplify wiring between the v3 Bus Pirate and an AVR ISP header. Tested with the <a href="http://www.johngineer.com/projects/bb313/">BB313</a>, and ATTiny4313/85s.</p>

<p>Add a 3 pin header and a jumper to power the target AVR from the Bus Pirate (for normal operation, programming, etc).</p>

<p>Check out the &ldquo;<em>Other work in this field</em>&rdquo; section below for other adapters as well (some of them support multiple protocols and programmers).</p>

</p>

<p>Source files and general instructions for printing can be found <a href="https://github.com/davidk/3D-Printable-BusPirate-DP6037">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Bus Pirate is a pretty fantastic device for sniffing around and working with new circuits. It can even <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate_AVR_Programming">act as an AVR programmer</a>.</p>

<p>After using one to fiddle with a few circuits, a case became necessary after seeing its value. While there are cases that can be purchased[1], a 3D printer was laying around waiting to be used.</p>

<p>Finding only a <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33517">case outline</a> (which proved to be extremely useful as a jumping off point) on Thingiverse, one needed to be made for the newer Bus Pirate.</p>

<p>After several hours (mostly spent re-calibrating the 3D printer, untangling filament, and playing musical notes with the timing belts), the printer popped out several iterations of cases.</p>

<p>The first few worked well, but were dependent on PLA &lsquo;rods and spikes&rsquo; (scrap filament cut and heated on a hotbed to straighten) and press-fitting to hold the top and bottom halves together. The USB header was also unexposed, which caused leveling issues (since it was higher than the rest of the board).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/bus-pirate-cases/bus-pirate-case-v1.png" alt="Printed Bus Pirate Case, Reject" />
</p>

<p>Going forward with several revisions, and many rejects later (about 12!), a decent case started appearing. Instead of PLA rods, a few 8mm long M3 machine screws and M3 hex nuts were used. They&rsquo;re not very common, but the M3s seem to fit rather well while providing a good degree of stability.</p>

<p>The assembly order from the bottom: M3 screw, bottom plate, PCB, hex nut, top plate.</p>

<p>While the top looks unsecured, it must actually be screwed/threaded in from the bottom with a decent amount of force.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/bus-pirate-cases/bus-pirate-case-v2-front.png" alt="Printed Bus Pirate Case, Front" />
</p>

<p>Polyimide tape was used on the back to protect the pins from being shorted out. The reason for not covering them in CAD is because they can be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=N60WSQc-G_8#t=416s">useful to probe</a> with a multimeter at times.</p>

<p>Files are posted <a href="https://github.com/davidk/3D-Printable-BusPirate-DP6037">here</a> (CC-BY-SA; via original author), but may change in the future if I ever get around to beating the thing into a different shape.</p>

<p>If you have an idea for a change, or can design a better one go for it!</p>

<h2 id="updates-errata:6c86a18651dceea50e592c955548af99">Updates &amp; Errata</h2>

<p>1-1-13: For many printers with a perfectly flat print bed (borosilicate glass, metal, etc), it may be advantageous to mirror the output on one axis so that the top gets printed perfectly flat.</p>

<p>With a borosilicate glass bed:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/bus-pirate-cases/bus-pirate-case-v2-front-mirrored.png" alt="Bus Pirate Case, mirrored shiny front" />
</p>

<p>The exported STL file has been added to the <a href="https://github.com/davidk/3D-Printable-BusPirate-DP6037">GitHub repository</a>. Look for <a href="https://github.com/davidk/3D-Printable-BusPirate-DP6037/blob/master/dp6037-top-axis-flipped.stl?raw=true">dp6037-top-axis-flipped.stl</a> when grabbing it (or click that link).</p>

<p>1-2-13: Yellow? Who prints stuff in yellow? Don&rsquo;t you have blue?</p>

<p>After a bit of recalibrating, this is what the case looks like in translucent blue. Not very high quality, but passable:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/bus-pirate-cases/bus-pirate-case-v2-front-mirrored-blue.png" alt="Bus Pirate Case, Translucent Blue" />
</p>

<p>1-3-13: Here is a better front panel (printed after mending the Z-axis into alignment), which will probably be the last update (in this series of days).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/bus-pirate-cases/bus_pirate_case_v2-front-mirrored-blue-improved.png" alt="Bus Pirate Case, Translucent Blue, Improved" />
</p>

<p>1-4-13: Added a link to source files at top and shortened/corrected more text to sound less silly.</p>

<h2 id="notes-references:6c86a18651dceea50e592c955548af99">Notes &amp; References</h2>

<p>[1] Note that buying an acrylic case is really the way to go. They <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/bus-pirate-v36-acrylic-case-v1-dp6037-p-1229.html?cPath=178_184">sell for about $3</a>).. but if you have a 3D printer, it probably needs to earn its keep anyway.</p>

<p>2014/11/12: This article&rsquo;s is in the process of being revisited. Please keep in mind that it is very old before using its instructions and resources.</p>

<p>GPS module connected to a Raspberry Pi (for accurate time keeping):</p>

</p>

<h2 id="a-primer-on-time:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">A primer on time</h2>

<p>Watch this brief video by
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=p2BxAu6WZI8">Bill Hammack, aka engineerguy on YouTube</a>. It covers the complexities of keeping very accurate time in a short video!</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/p2BxAu6WZI8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2 id="where-ntp-fits-in:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Where NTP fits in</h2>

<p>Being on synchronized time is pretty important. Is your office clock faster or slower than the one on your watch? What about your phone? What if you turn it off for a month? A year?</p>

<p>In other to get time from very accurate sources, some devices and services use the Network Time Protocol (NTP for short) to keep their time synchronized. Your device is probably using NTP as you read this!</p>

<p><strong><em>How it works</em></strong>: Periodically, your computer will connect to servers that speak NTP. After getting the time, your system does some math (to account for transmission delays, and bad clocks), and adjusts the system clock. This periodic synchronization keeps a clock from drifting too far behind, or too far ahead from the world standard.</p>

<p>By itself though, NTP does not provide accurate time information. This the job of a dedicated reference clock.</p>

<p>A reference clock is a precise source of time, and these are connected to a computer which transmit their data over a network using NTP.</p>

<p>In our case, we can (ab)use a GPS unit as a reference device (in GPS, accurate positioning requires very accurate time). While not a lab quality reference clock, it has enough accuracy for most applications.</p>

<h2 id="strata:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Strata</h2>

<p>In NTP parlance, time systems are arranged into different strata. Each level (starting from zero), determines how far away you are from a clock source. [1]</p>

<p><strong><em>Stratum 0</em></strong>: Cesium/Rubidium-based clocks, radio and GPS clocks. Depending on precision, these can be very, very, very accurate (and really expensive too)!</p>

<p><strong><em>Stratum 1</em></strong>: Computers attached to Stratum 0 sources. They expose the data from <strong><em>Stratum 0</em></strong> to the world.</p>

<p><strong><em>Stratum 2</em></strong>: Collector of stratum 1 time over a network. May punt bad stratum 1 clocks (e.g. stop listening to them).</p>

<p><strong><em>Stratum N</em></strong>: N level away from 0, does the same as 2.</p>

<p><strong><em>Stratum 16</em></strong>: Considered to be unsynchronized.</p>

<p>Most consumers of NTP data collect information from stratum 2 (or higher) sources.</p>

<p>For instance, Apple&rsquo;s <strong>time.apple.com</strong> server is a stratum 2 time source. It might be connected to a bunch of stratum 1 time sources. In turn, the stratum 1 computers would be connected to a gaggle of stratum 0 reference clocks.</p>

<p>Being a stratum 2 source, it figures out which stratum 1 time source(s) it can trust and aggregates all the data between those. Using a bit of math, it figures out which sources seem bad, and kicks those results to the curb.</p>

<p>That brings us to setting up our own GPS-sourced clock. Why?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Perhaps you are stuck on a remote island without a reliable Internet
connection.</p></li>

<li><p>You have some sort of experiment that needs to have great timing.</p></li>

<li><p>You&rsquo;re going to use the GPS hookup for something else entirely (like a phone   home device), and want the meat on how to do that. (Sure!)</p></li>

<li><p>You feel like abusing a NTP server for some reason, or policy prevents you
from getting accurate time through the Internet.</p></li>

<li><p>Having your own time server is cool.</p></li>

<li><p>Say this in an Australian accent, or with an accent that features a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_rising_terminal">high rising terminal</a> so it sounds more awesome: &ldquo;Why the heck not!&rdquo;</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="difficulties:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Difficulties</h2>

<p>Beyond this point, this becomes a slightly advanced article. You&rsquo;ll most likely be comfortable with a bit of prior Raspberry Pi/Linux/Electronics experience under your belt.</p>

<p>I try to explain steps throughly, and provide links to external sources which should help even if you are a beginner.</p>

<h2 id="parts-list:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Parts List</h2>

<p>All of these parts are available from one vendor, so you don&rsquo;t have to order and coordinate shipping times. The vendor used here is Adafruit. They&rsquo;re well regarded with very reasonable policies and good people.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/998">Raspberry Pi</a> - The brains of the project! Raspberry Pis sell out fast, so buying from another vendor may be the only possible way of acquiring one.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/746">Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout, v3</a> a very compact GPS unit with 1PPS output. (<em>Note</em>: If you have a v1 or v2, you can still get a 1PPS signal &ndash; you&rsquo;ll need to solder a small wire to the exposed pad. See the PDF documentation for a pinout.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Hardware voltage warning: If you are using another GPS, please mind the GPIO pin voltages as they are only 3.3v tolerant. There is no over-voltage protection on the board. This means a bad connection could easily kill a pin or worse.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/289">Wires</a> - If you will be using the Pi Cobbler below along with a standard breadboard, the wires should just be solid core wire. If you will be wiring the GPS up directly (using the provided header), they should probably be Female/Female jumpers.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/995">Ethernet Cable</a> - Or wireless adapter to connect. Definitely check old router boxes for this.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/102">SD Card</a> - For loading a distribution. You probably have one of these already lying around.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/501">Power Adapter</a> - The power adapter should terminate to a micro USB cable (these are the slimmer &ldquo;phone charger&rdquo; cables). Be sure to look for an adapter with a current rating of around 850mA (or more).</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="optional:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Optional</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/914">Raspberry Pi Cobbler</a> - This makes identifying the proper pins a piece of.. cake (pun intended).</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/859">Raspberry Pi Box</a> - A simple enclosure that can have the breadboard stacked on top of it.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/64">Breadboard</a> - For use with the cobbler.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="distribution:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Distribution</h2>

<h2 id="initial-setup:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Initial Setup</h2>

<p>After flashing your SD card, insert the card and boot the Raspberry Pi by plugging it in.</p>

<p>Edit <code>/boot/cmdline.txt</code>, along with <code>/etc/inittab</code> to free up the UART (which shows up on <code>/dev/ttyAMA0</code>) so that the NMEA &ldquo;serial&rdquo; data can be read on the Pi.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

# Remove these in cmdline.txt:
# `console=ttyAMA0,115200`
# and `kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200`.
# Mine looks like this:

dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait
</code></pre>

<p>Hold <code>CTRL+o</code> and hit <code>[Enter]</code> to save. Then hold <code>CTRL+x</code> to exit.</p>

<p>Next, edit <code>/etc/inittab</code> and comment out, or remove the last line in this file (page down till you see it):</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo nano /etc/inittab
#Spawn a getty on Raspberry Pi serial line
#T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyAMA0 115200 vt100
</code></pre>

<p>Once you are done, power off the Pi and begin connecting things to it!</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo poweroff

# Remove the power connector when only the PWR LED remains lit/screen
# goes blank and begin attaching things.
</code></pre>

<p>Connect the following pins (Raspberry Pi is on the right, GPS on the left):</p>

<p>Here is a really boring pin out diagram:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">GPS     RPI
---     ---
RX  --&gt; TXD
TX  --&gt; RXD
PPS --&gt; GPIO #23
GND --&gt; GND
VIN --&gt; 5V0
</code></pre>

<p>Wiring for the Adafruit Ultimate GPS v3 (RX-&gt;TXD isn&rsquo;t connected):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ulti_gps_v3.png" alt="Adafruit Ultimate GPS v3" />
</p>

<p>For the v2, with a wire soldered onto the 1PPS pad (the 1PPS wire goes to the blue one off image, which then leads to GPIO #23):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ulti_gps_v2.png" alt="Adafruit Ultimate GPS v2" />
</p>

<p>If you need background on where GPIO pin 23 is located when connecting directly, see <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals">this page at elinux.org</a>. Otherwise, GPIO #23 is just #23 if you&rsquo;re using the Pi Cobbler.</p>

<p>Once everything is connected and you&rsquo;ve verified everything twice, connect the power.</p>

<h2 id="1pps:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">1PPS</h2>

<p>You may be wondering about the PPS pin!</p>

<p>While NMEA data is good enough for synchronizing time to within a few hundred milliseconds, it can be bad for applications that require precision timing, or just plain bad if you&rsquo;re obsessed with getting precise time.</p>

<p>This is where the PPS pin we connected earlier comes into play. <em>1PPS</em> or <strong>One Pulse Per Second</strong>, is a signal that says &ldquo;here is the precise start of a second!&rdquo; A PPS signal is usually accurate to a few nanoseconds give or take whatever is in the path between sender and receiver.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/gps_1pps.png" alt="1PPS signal" />
</p>

<p>Alone, 1PPS can only tell you the precise start of a second, so anything that wants to set time accurately needs <em>both</em> NMEA data and 1PPS information.</p>

<p>To effectively utilize 1PPS, we&rsquo;ll have to patch the kernel and add support.</p>

<h2 id="switching-the-kernel:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Switching The Kernel</h2>

<p>Doing this isn&rsquo;t particularly hard. However, keep in mind that it will overwrite any special modifications you&rsquo;ve already done to the kernel, and will break on upgrades to the kernel.</p>

<p>In order to keep things simple, I have a repository with pre-made kernel modules and kernel image. If you&rsquo;d like to view the source this is based on, <a href="https://github.com/davidk/adafruit-raspberrypi-linux">click here</a>. [2]</p>

<p>To grab the pre-compiled kernel and modules:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git clone https://github.com/davidk/adafruit-raspberrypi-linux-pps.git
</code></pre>

<p>Back up and copy the kernel image:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ cd adafruit-raspberrypi-linux-pps
$ sudo mv /boot/kernel.img /boot/kernel.img.orig
$ sudo cp kernel.img /boot
</code></pre>

<p>Move the modules over:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo mv modules/* /lib/modules
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, add the <code>pps-gpio</code> module to /etc/modules.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># Run this command in a sub-shell so appending works
$ sudo sh -c &quot;echo 'pps-gpio' &gt;&gt; /etc/modules&quot;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="automatically-making-links-in-etc-udev:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Automatically Making Links In /etc/udev</h2>

<p>By default, our setup isn&rsquo;t usable by the NTP server since it expects data to be present at specific locations. By adding a few rules to udev, we can automatically make symbolic links (aliases, shortcuts, etc) from our NMEA serial and 1PPS data, to a place where NTP can read and interpret it.</p>

<p>If we didn&rsquo;t create these rules, the NTP driver would get no data to process.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/80-gps-to-ntp.rules
# Change MODE of ttyAMA0 so it is readable by NTP and provide a symlink to
# /dev/gps0
KERNEL==&quot;ttyAMA0&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;tty&quot;, DRIVER==&quot;&quot;, SYMLINK+=&quot;gps0&quot;, MODE=&quot;0666&quot;
# Symlink /dev/pps0 to /dev/gpspps0
KERNEL==&quot;pps0&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;pps&quot;, DRIVER==&quot;&quot;, SYMLINK+=&quot;gpspps0&quot;, MODE=&quot;0666&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Hold <code>CTRL+o</code> to write the file, tap <code>[Enter]</code> and then hold <code>CTRL+x</code> to exit.</p>

<h2 id="installing-and-configuring-ntp:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Installing and Configuring NTP</h2>

<p>To install NTP, we abuse the default install a bit since the repository version doesn&rsquo;t really pick up on 1PPS. It will also take some time to do all of this since we&rsquo;re compiling from scratch.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo apt-get install ntp
$ sudo apt-get remove ntp
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libcap-dev
$ sudo apt-get install pps-tools
$ wget http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/ntp_spool/ntp4/ntp-dev/ntp-dev-4.2.7p319.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf ntp-dev-4.2.7p319.tar.gz
$ cd ntp-dev-4.2.7p319

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-all-clocks --enable-parse-clocks \
--enable-SHM --enable-debugging --sysconfdir=/var/lib/ntp --with-sntp=no \
--with-lineeditlibs=edit --without-ntpsnmpd --disable-local-libopts \
--disable-dependency-tracking &amp;&amp; make
$ sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>Be sure to edit /etc/init.d/ntp and change the DAEMON line:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo nano /etc/init.d/ntp
DAEMON=/usr/bin/ntpd
#DAEMON=/usr/sbin/ntpd
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have been dropped back to the terminal, edit <code>/etc/ntp.conf</code> and add the following (be sure to change the broadcast line if it differs for you):</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo nano /etc/ntp.conf

</code></pre>

<p>For a general setup with an Internet connected Pi, leaving these uncommented is generally considered good practice.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">server 0.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst

</code></pre>

<p>What do the bits in the server line do? [3]</p>

<h4 id="server-127-127-20-0-mode-17-minpoll-3-iburst-true-prefer:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">server 127.127.20.0 mode 17 minpoll 3 iburst true prefer</h4>

<li><p><code>mode 17</code>: This sets the line speed (bit 4, dec: 16) to 9600 bps. Additionally, $GPRMC is processed (bit 0, dec: 1). We get a total sum of 17 when adding the decimal parts together (hence &ldquo;mode 17&rdquo;).</p></li>

<li><p><code>minpoll</code>: Minimum polling interval for NTP messages in a power of 2. Here, 3 = 8 seconds.</p></li>

<li><p><code>iburst</code>: If a server is unreachable, send a burst of eight packets instead of one.</p></li>

<li><p><code>true</code>: Let the server survive NTP&rsquo;s algorithmic weeding.</p></li>

<li><p><code>prefer</code>: If we have a choice among good hosts (post-determination, etc), use this one for syncing.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p><code>flag1 1</code>: Activate PPSAPI, and process the PPS signals we get.</p></li>

<li><p><code>time2</code>: Compensate slightly for transmission delays. Instructions for tuning this are located on the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/drivers/driver20.html">driver home page</a>. Specifically, look for 7 (bit) / 128 (decimal) in the mode section.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A complete explanation of the flags used is provided at the website above. You can also just <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/drivers/driver20.html">click here</a> to be taken there as well.</p>

<h2 id="reboot:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Reboot</h2>

<p>Now that the kernel is updated, udev makes links properly, and NTP is installed+configured.. all that is left to do is pray to your local noodly appendage (or other $x of choice) and reboot.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<h2 id="checking-the-time:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Checking the time</h2>

<p>Once you&rsquo;re back up, wait for your GPS to lock (give it a view of the sky to make this process faster).</p>

<p>When your GPS is locked to a sufficient number of satellites (the Adafruit GPS module will blink intermittently), type <code>ntpq -p</code> into your Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s console, and you&rsquo;ll get something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ntpq -p
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
==============================================================================
oGPS_NMEA(0)     .GPS.            0 l    8    8  377    0.000   -0.025   0.002
</code></pre>

<h2 id="unit-calibration-skip-if-not-using-adafruit-s-gps-module:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Unit Calibration (skip if not using Adafruit&rsquo;s GPS module)</h2>

<p>To get the best out of the Adafruit GPS unit, we will tune it so that it outputs only the sentences we need. In particular, we&rsquo;re interested only in the $GPRMC lines.</p>

<p>Before continuing, ensure that the RX (GPS) to TXD (Raspberry Pi) line is connected. Add an extra wire if it isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Note that these changes are not permanent; they will be lost during a power cycle (install a battery to prevent this from happening), or reverted using another command. [5]</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ echo -e '$PMTK314,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0*29\r\n' &gt; /dev/ttyAMA0
</code></pre>

<p>This command squelches all of the other NMEA sentences and only outputs $GPRMC, making everything tick a little more efficiently. To verify that the proper sentences are being output, run:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash"># Tap CTRL+C to exit
$ cat /dev/ttyAMA0
$PGTOP ....
$GPRMC ....
</code></pre>

<p>In certain cases, it may take several tries in order to get the unit to recognize the command properly.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in playing around with the outputs, check out <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/PMTK_A08.pdf">this PDF</a>, and use this <a href="http://www.hhhh.org/wiml/proj/nmeaxor.html">checksum calculator</a> to get the value at the end (this means that if we change the line above, the <code>*29</code> value changes when the command changes.. so we would need to calculate a new checksum!).</p>

<h2 id="lights:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Lights!</h2>

<p>On a system with <code>ntpdate</code> (a Linux or OS X system usually has this utility), we can query the Raspberry Pi to get and/or set the time.</p>

<p>If the last line says &ldquo;Server dropped: Leap not in sync&rdquo; &ndash; it may take some time for trust in the time to be established. This tends to be on the order of minutes; if it happens, wait around 26 to 30 minutes and try again.</p>

<h2 id="integration:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Integration</h2>

<p>Ideally, this itself would be automated somehow. Each system has a time setting that allows you to set the time sync source.</p>

<h3 id="os-x:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">OS X</h3>

<p>Click the time at the top right, and click Date &amp; Time Preferences. Type in your Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s address next to &ldquo;Set date and time automatically.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="linux:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Linux</h3>

<p>If using a desktop, this tends to be handled in a GUI menu. If not, check to see if you have, or can install a NTP daemon. Then edit ntp.conf (usually located in the /etc/ directory) and set the <code>server</code> stanza as appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="windows:f0add37b64850e1a23640fa819df10c0">Windows</h2>

<p><code>11/12/12</code>: Thanks to @karldyson for reporting that PPS was not being picked up properly by the repository packages. Looks like that bug is still there!</p>

<p><code>12/24/12</code>: Added information on calibrating Adafruit&rsquo;s GPS module (including references) and updated offset in configuration. Clobbered the introduction and added more spelling errors/walls of text to confuse/clarify things a bit.</p>

<p><code>1/15/13</code>: Changed the hardware voltage warning (fixed non-serious typo). Also tried to un-break formatting for note #5 and redirected help to a more proper place.</p>

<p><code>02/05/13</code>: Added a reminder to connect the proper line before working on
the Adafruit GPS module.</p>

<p><code>02/06/13</code>: The DAEMON line in /etc/init.d/ntp had a typo, and should be /usr/bin/ntpd (due to the prefix used).</p>

<p><code>03/03/13</code>: Thanks to both Sven Wunder and @davidmonro_ for reporting that pps-tools needs to be installed during a compile of NTP from source.</p>

<p><code>05/09/13</code>: Collapsed the configure line (it was tested to be cut and paste friendly), and reduced the amount of make by one.</p>
