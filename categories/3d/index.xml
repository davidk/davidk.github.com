      <title>Printable divider for the 10164 storage drawer</title>

      <description>This is a 3D printable small drawer divider for the Akro-Mils 10164 parts cabinet.
The clear drawers themselves have a nice little slot for partitioning, so this divider fits right in and sits snugly without bowing out the drawer.
While there are several dividers that come attached to the back of the cabinet (which are manually de-paneled by the end consumer), they&amp;rsquo;re very limited in quantity.
So if you have a 3D printer of some sort, or want to play with the model enough to make it &amp;lsquo;go&amp;rsquo; on a laser cutter/CNC, give this a shot.</description>

      <description>Source files and general instructions for printing can be found here.
The Bus Pirate is a pretty fantastic device for sniffing around and working with new circuits. It can even act as an AVR programmer.
After using one to fiddle with a few circuits, a case became necessary after seeing its value. While there are cases that can be purchased[1], a 3D printer was laying around waiting to be used.</description>
