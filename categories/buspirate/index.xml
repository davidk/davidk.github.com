      <description>A little bit of the cat got out of the bag some time ago:
You&amp;rsquo;re looking at ~24 hours of continuous AVR flashing compressed down into 6 seconds.
While I won&amp;rsquo;t be releasing the connecting PCB just yet (i&amp;rsquo;m still beating down a few issues and refining the BOM), I thought it would be good to supply the scripts I used to do the actual time lapse since it was non-obvious from a &amp;ldquo;oh dear, the contest entry is due in &amp;lt;48 hours isn&amp;rsquo;t it.</description>

      <description>Source files and general instructions for printing can be found here.
The Bus Pirate is a pretty fantastic device for sniffing around and working with new circuits. It can even act as an AVR programmer.
After using one to fiddle with a few circuits, a case became necessary after seeing its value. While there are cases that can be purchased[1], a 3D printer was laying around waiting to be used.</description>
