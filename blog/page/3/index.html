<p><em>(5/11/13) - Hey fantastic reader: This is an old how-to (from 4/2/12!) that existed in its own self-contained repository. Reflecting back, this hack was kind of silly, but i&rsquo;m porting it here to keep everything in one place.</em></p>

<p><em>And if you&rsquo;re curious about the long-term viability of this build.. it is still kicking. The detents are a little less crisp now, but everything works a treat. (And now, back to your regularly scheduled post re-run!)</em></p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t too long ago that volume control on a keyboard was a foreign concept. After it became a &lsquo;feature&rsquo;, that control seemed pretty normal. There is however, a slight modern exception now. Many mechanical keyboards (which have been coming back into style) don&rsquo;t have them.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/volcontrol/overview.png" alt="overview" />
</p>

<p>In response, I hacked this together. It&rsquo;s a volume controller which parses a rotary encoder&rsquo;s input
and controls the volume (tested on OS X/Windows/Linux so far).</p>

<h3 id="parts-bill-of-materials:a8f7eabc62bf84464c72c579bacd87aa">Parts/Bill of Materials:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/16">Altoids Gum sized tin</a> - A slick enclosure. Scratches easily though.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/377">Rotary Encoder</a> - I&rsquo;ve tried a bunch. A lot of them either failed over time, or the &lsquo;clicks&rsquo; (detents) became mushy. This one comes with a cool looking knob and is panel mountable too.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/296">Adafruit Atmega32u4 Breakout</a> - Brains of the operation. Comes with headers. For this particular project, just keep the headers for a rainy day.</p></li>

<li><p>Wire - Will need these to hook up the rotary encoder. Stranded wire is preferable since it can bend and flex.</p></li>

<li><p>Perfboard - While you can go without, the perfboard is nice to relieve the stress on the rotary encoder pins. I haven&rsquo;t run across an economical source of cuttable copper-clad perf; they&rsquo;re usually so large that I feel guilty slicing them apart. <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/589">These</a> seem to be the right size, but are rather thick (I haven&rsquo;t sliced these apart yet). Use anything that works.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Optional (or you already have these if you&rsquo;re thinking this is a good weekend project):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/436">Sugru</a> - I used this stuff to attach the board to the tin. Anything non-conductive works (determine the amount of adhesion based on your projected re-use of these parts).</p></li>

<li><p>Soldering iron + Solder - Needed to join all the parts together.</p></li>

<li><p>Mini-B USB cable - This is the cable type that the breakout board accepts.</p></li>

<li><p>Drill/set of bits - To make a hole so that the encoder can poke out of.</p></li>

<li><p>Something to cut with - For perfboard cutting, wire stripping, prying the enclosure, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="electronics-assembly:a8f7eabc62bf84464c72c579bacd87aa">Electronics assembly</h3>

<p>Start by cutting perf for the rotary encoder. Put on your safety glasses (and quite possibly a dust mask just to be extra cautious). Cutting perfboard (and other things too!) can cause pieces of it to fly into your eyeballs.</p>

<p>To cut the perfboard by hand, score 5-7 times along the holes that mark the edges of the cut (make sure to dry fit before cutting). I had better cuts by scoring along the entire length of the perf (although this means some perf ends up being wasted).</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;re ready to cut, take a pair of shears (dull diagonal cutters work too) and clip a notch where your scored lines meet the edges. This should serve as a guide for your snap (the concept is similar to tearing a notch in a piece of folded paper before ripping it apart cleanly). Slowly bend the perf where the score is and the perf should snap apart. If it resists or seems like it won&rsquo;t snap along the score line, score some more and repeat.</p>

<p>If that fails, break out a dust mask, a pair of safety glasses (you should already be wearing these!), and just start hacksawing. It won&rsquo;t be very pretty, but it should work.</p>

<p>The next step is to solder the encoder in. Insert the encoder and tack a leg with solder to hold it in place. Ensure everything is aligned the way you like it (check that there is room for the wiring below), and solder the rest of the pins in.</p>

<p>The wiring can be deceptively tricky. Measure out enough wire so that you can open/close the box. Cut, strip and tin the wires. You&rsquo;ll need 5 wires.</p>

<p>Here is the wire mapping (looking from top to down at the rotary encoder, with three pins on top and two on the bottom):</p>

<p>Solder all the wires together. Once the wires are attached to the perf, blob some solder to bridge the wiring and the encoder pins together.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/volcontrol/encoderwiring.png" alt="encoder wiring" />
</p>

<h3 id="enclosure:a8f7eabc62bf84464c72c579bacd87aa">Enclosure</h3>

<p>To drill a hole for the encoder, find a bit size that matches (the datasheet says it is 6mm / .236 inches or just around a <sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>64</sub> drill bit (.234 inches)). Measure for dead center on both axes (or like a professor once told me: &lsquo;eyeball it until your OCD stops&rsquo;). Mark the drill point.</p>

<p>If it makes it easier, it is possible to remove the lid from the body. Simply bend the hinged tabs outward and the lid will slide off. Reverse to fit the lid back on.</p>

<p>You may need to brace the back of the drill area with a block of scrap wood to prevent warping. Drill from the outside in (so that all the unsightly edges are hidden somewhat). Don&rsquo;t apply too much pressure (you won&rsquo;t be able to undent things easily).</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;re done, dry fit the encoder but don&rsquo;t screw it into place yet.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/volcontrol/enclosure.png" alt="enclosure" />
</p>

<p>For the USB port, buttress the breakout board against the bottom of the enclosure and mark an approximate outline. Using a drill, begin drilling into the case (the hole won&rsquo;t be large enough, but we&rsquo;ll fix that in a bit). With the hole made, take your shears and carefully pry to make an opening wide enough for the USB plug to poke out. Continue to check the fit while slowly prying. Don&rsquo;t worry if it looks too ugly. The USB plug covers up most of the mess.</p>

<h3 id="final-assembly:a8f7eabc62bf84464c72c579bacd87aa">Final assembly</h3>

<p>Before adhering the breakout board (permanently, depending on your preference); lets test everything.</p>

<p>Compiling:</p>

<p>Unfortunately I haven&rsquo;t had all that much luck compiling on OS X (using Homebrew packages), and I haven&rsquo;t tried on Windows at all. Only Linux has worked so far. All hope is not lost however, you can manually program the breakout with avrdude! Read on to &lsquo;Skipping all of that&rsquo;.</p>

<p>These are the packages I have installed for Fedora which are needed to compile:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo yum -y install avr-libc avrdude avr-gcc avr-binutils git
</code></pre>

<p>Next, grab a copy of the LUFA git repository that includes the necessary modifications:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ git clone git://github.com/davidk/lufa-lib.git
$ cd lufa-lib
$ git checkout -b atmega32u4-mediacontroller origin/atmega32u4-mediacontroller
$ cd trunk/Projects/MediaController
$ make all
</code></pre>

<p>If the compile was successful, connect the breakout board to your computer. Type the following into your console,
hit enter, but don&rsquo;t type in your password yet.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo make program
</code></pre>

<p>Going back to the breakout board, hit the white button (a green light should slowly start fading in and out indicating that the breakout is ready to be programmed). Type in your password and watch it go. If avrdude had
problems finding your 32u4 breakout, run <code>dmesg</code> and check the output for something along the lines of <code>ttyACM</code>. The last part should be a number. Modify the <code>makefile</code> with the new port and re-run the line.</p>

<p>Here is what my dmesg looks like:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/volcontrol/dmesg.png" alt="dmesg" />
</p>

<p>Skipping all of that:</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re on OS X or Windows.. or just don&rsquo;t like compiling, get the <a href="/assets/code/volcontrol/MediaController.hex">hex file</a>, press the white bootloader button, and run the following (a working example for OS X):</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ avrdude -p atmega32u4 -P /dev/tty.usbmodem621 -c avr109 -U flash:w:MediaController.hex
</code></pre>

<p>Change <code>/dev/tty.usbmodem621</code> as appropriate for your platform. On OS X, if at first /dev/tty.usbmodem612 doesn&rsquo;t work, use tab-completion to fill in the remaining section. Enter <code>/dev/tty.usb</code> and tap tab to get relevant entries when the bootloader light is active.</p>

<p>Finishing up:
Do volume up/down and mute (pushing down on the encoder) work properly? If so, time to finish up! If not, make sure
that the board is programmed (it shows up as <code>LUFA Media Controller</code> in <code>dmesg</code>, and similarly under the OS X System Profiler). Also ensure the connections between all the parts are nice and solid.</p>

<p>If everything is finished, open a pack of Sugru (or the adhesive you&rsquo;re using), and stick things together.
Next, poke the rotary encoder through the hole on the lid. Then secure it with the hardware provided and add the nice looking control knob to top it off.</p>

<p>Here is what mine looks like now; it is magnetically attached to the keyboard (no ill effects yet).</p>

<h3 id="attributions:a8f7eabc62bf84464c72c579bacd87aa">Attributions:</h3>

<p>This project uses code and examples provided by LUFA (which is MIT licensed). Thats by Dean Camera.
The code to read the rotary code comes from a posting by circuitsathome <a href="http://www.circuitsathome.com/mcu/reading-rotary-encoder-on-arduino">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="improvements-chaos-and-cost-reductions:a8f7eabc62bf84464c72c579bacd87aa">Improvements, chaos, and cost reductions:</h3>

<p>From a performance and cost perspective, the breakout used for this project is overkill; building an ATTiny breakout might be more worthwhile. Also,
it might be possible to just rip the guts out of an old keyboard and use its media controller functions with some
modding.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/3dprinting/pocket-level-x-bridge.png" alt="Pocket level" />
</p>

<p><strong><em>A pocket level ensures things are reasonably level before further calibration and fine tuning</em></strong></p>

<p>These are few of the things i&rsquo;ve used/and bought over the past few months while owning a 3D printer. If you&rsquo;re new to the 3D printing world (and making, in general), collecting and/or using some of these will make your life easier.</p>

<p>These are the basics, so you may be able to borrow these from a (friendly) maker and/or tinkerer.</p>

<h3 id="thread-locking-fluid:a7a6f00eceb9f81ba78c566e527b0395">Thread-locking fluid</h3>

<p>In the first few <del>months</del> weeks of owning my 3D printer, I made the mistake of assembling my printer without thread-locking fluid. Of course, bolts and screws fell off during long prints causing incalculable amounts of wasted time and filament.</p>

<p>Thread locker (or the stuff by its popular brand name: <strong><em>Loctite</em></strong>) keeps a bolt from freeing itself (usually via vibration forces), while allowing it to be removed by hand if needed.</p>

<p>Adding loctite is best done during a printer build. If certain parts are constantly coming loose, working it in as needed will do too.</p>

<p><strong><em>Part #: 91458A115  (McMaster-Carr, Loctite 243, Blue)</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="stuff-to-make-things-move:a7a6f00eceb9f81ba78c566e527b0395">Stuff to make things move</h3>

<p>For squeaks, metal on metal noises, or just for things that move and make contact, adding a few drops of lubricant is occasionally needed to keep things in good form.</p>

<p>Some printing guides prefer sprays (especially on vertical areas like Z-axis rods). For several months i&rsquo;ve been using a liquid lubricant, which contains PTFE (without issue so far). I didn&rsquo;t intend to use it for my printer, but it ended up working quite well.</p>

<p><strong><em>Part #: 1155K33 (McMaster-Carr). You get a lot for about $5 (not including shipping of course).</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="pocket-level:a7a6f00eceb9f81ba78c566e527b0395">Pocket level</h3>

<p>On my particular printer, there is the potential for a lot of things to go out of alignment (either due to stresses at rest, or operator error). A small level is great for getting things into a general ball park for further fine tuning.</p>

<p>The Stabila Pocket Level ($10) is magnetic (the magnetized area isn&rsquo;t obvious, but it is on the bottom). It also has a very clear window for viewing the bubble, and is slightly more fluid than some of the other bubble levels I have on hand.</p>

<p>While it is a bit expensive for a smaller level (slightly larger levels like torpedo levels are well within or below its price), this is a pretty good quality level that seems like it will last.</p>

<p>It will also (unlike torpedo levels) fit into areas with very little clearance.</p>

<p>What does it look like? Scroll up a bit. :)</p>

<p><strong><em>Part #: <a href="http://amzn.com/B0012N368M">Stabila 11990 Pocket Level</a> - (Amazon)</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="cable-zip-ties:a7a6f00eceb9f81ba78c566e527b0395">Cable/zip ties</h3>

<p>If your printer looks anything like mine, nearly everything (including the pullies and even some of the linear bearings) are held together by these ties. And sometimes readjusting things means cutting those ties.</p>

<p>For a few bucks you can stop cursing while trying to find a replacement tie.</p>

<p><strong><em>Part #: 7130K41 (McMaster-Carr). These are the smaller &lsquo;micro&rsquo; zip ties, and come in a large enough pack to stave off regret at the amount of zip tie waste you&rsquo;re bound to generate.</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="long-screwdriver-racheting-driver:a7a6f00eceb9f81ba78c566e527b0395">Long screwdriver/racheting driver</h3>

<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t have a screwdriver? (Answer: A person who needs one right now.)</p>

<p>A ratcheting driver makes a surprising difference on a printer.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been quite happy with a Stanley Ratcheting Screwdriver ($10). The shortened turn in ratchet mode is great when working in tight spaces (where it is hard/annoying to do &ldquo;full&rdquo; turns).</p>

<p>This particular driver comes with several extra bits hidden in the endcap and has the ability to become a normal/fixed screwdriver with a twist of the knob.</p>

<p>Normal screwdrivers are more than enough though, and this is really just optional.</p>

<p>*** Part #: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stanley-69-189-Ratcheting-Multi-Bit-Screwdriver/dp/B002I3TDP0/">Stanley 69-189 Ratcheting Multi-Bit Screwdriver</a> - (Amazon)***</p>

<h2 id="other-accessories:a7a6f00eceb9f81ba78c566e527b0395">Other accessories</h2>

<p>These are parts that I have no specific recommendation for, but once you have them you may wonder what you did without them!</p>

<h3 id="straight-tweezers:a7a6f00eceb9f81ba78c566e527b0395">Straight tweezers</h3>

<p>At working temperatures, the extruder gets really hot. And print beds do as well. To save yourself from getting actual 3D printing battle scars, get a pair of tweezers to pluck out stray strands of filament.</p>

<p>During warm up, just use the tweezers to pluck at the extruder, or to scrape off a small starting failure/error from the bed that has failed to adhere.</p>

<p>It is likely that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to use an ESD-style tweezer (they&rsquo;re often colored black with a matte finish). Mostly this is because some of them have a lightly applied coating that scratches easily. Save the ESD tweezers for sensitive electronics work.</p>

<h3 id="flush-cutters:a7a6f00eceb9f81ba78c566e527b0395">Flush cutters</h3>

<p>Cutting filament is kind of an afterthought, but it needs to be done (usually when loading and unloading new/used filament). A pair of throwaway flush cutters will make doing so quick and easy.</p>

<p>It probably isn&rsquo;t a good idea to use new or flush cutters you love. Certain plastics like PLA are fairly hard, which may cause faster wear and tear on cutters. Then again, decent cutters can be had for a good price nowadays (Xcelite cutters are pretty decent! Mouser Part #: 578-175M).</p>

<h3 id="detachable-reusable-spool:a7a6f00eceb9f81ba78c566e527b0395">Detachable/Reusable spool</h3>

<p>Using filament freestyle without any sort of management is a recipe for disaster over time. <em>Many</em> of my early troubles were due to buying spool-less, (but wound filament) and trying to wing it without a spool.</p>

<p>If I went to sleep, got a drink or otherwise looked away for a bit, the filament would somehow find a way to tangle, feed incorrectly, or do nasty things like snap (after tensing up due to tangling).</p>

<p>After resorting to hacks, (like turning the filament bag itself into a spool holder), I got kind of fed up and decided to just get a reusable spool.</p>

<p>A decent one for small quantities (1 lb, or 454 grams for everyone else), consists of a spool that can have the side detached (usually via screws) and filament loaded in.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that the filament doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be completely flush with the hub for small quantities (perhaps <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> a pound or less), just &lsquo;enclosed&rsquo; by the spool walls.</p>

<p>Some good features to look out for are pre-drilled holes to put the filament ends into, and a standard diameter/width size (if you&rsquo;ll be using multiple spools with a particular spool feeding system/holder).</p>

<p>For most spool setups, they should be mounted on some sort of holder where the filament can be pulled into the extruder smoothly (and consistently).</p>

<h3 id="spool-holder:a7a6f00eceb9f81ba78c566e527b0395">Spool holder</h3>

<p>There are plenty of <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:52558">examples on Thingiverse</a> of spool holders. Some can be purchased for $8 and some can be made out of PVC pipe. Don&rsquo;t forgo this for too long, as it is a pretty good addition to your printing kit if it isn&rsquo;t already built-in to your printer.</p>

<h3 id="tongue-and-groove-pliers:a7a6f00eceb9f81ba78c566e527b0395">Tongue-and-Groove Pliers</h3>

<p>Otherwise known as Channellocks (which is also the name of the company that created them), these pliers are pretty great to have around, either to remove a print with brute force (if necessary, and if your print allows for it), or for tightening things.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have these already, they can be cheaply had at many stores (McMaster-Carr also sells them), and are useful for other things around your home as well.</p>

<h3 id="calipers:a7a6f00eceb9f81ba78c566e527b0395">Calipers</h3>

<p>This is usually required by every &ldquo;Welcome to your brand new 3D printer!&rdquo; guide. You&rsquo;ll need one to calibrate things like extrusion amounts (when loading new filament) and to bring physical objects into CAD for printing.</p>

<p>Be sure to do extra research on the different types of calipers out there, as quality can vary a lot between types (veiner vs digital) and brands (Mitutoyo vs dollar store type).</p>

<h3 id="blue-painter-s-tape:a7a6f00eceb9f81ba78c566e527b0395">Blue Painter&rsquo;s Tape</h3>

<p>A spool of something like <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; 3M Blue Painters&rsquo; Tape will work very well as a surface for your PLA print to adhere to (as long as the first few layers are pressed down into the tape proper). The larger width also makes resurfacing fairly easy.</p>

<p>(ABS users will want to look into Kapton/Polyimide tape or squares)</p>

<p>Best of luck in your printing adventures!</p>

<p>cheers</p>

<p>This is a 3D printable small drawer divider for the Akro-Mils 10164 parts cabinet.</p>

<p>The clear drawers themselves have a nice little slot for partitioning, so this divider fits right in and sits snugly without bowing out the drawer.</p>

<p>While there are several dividers that come attached to the back of the cabinet (which are manually de-paneled by the end consumer), they&rsquo;re very limited in quantity.</p>

<p>So if you have a 3D printer of some sort, or want to play with the model enough to make it &lsquo;go&rsquo; on a laser cutter/CNC, give this a shot.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this <strong><em>will not</em></strong> fit the larger drawers like on the 10144.</p>

<p>Download the STL file <a href="https://github.com/davidk/3D-Printable-Parts-Divider">here</a>.</p>

<p>To prevent ambiguities, the license for this (simple work) is WTFPL. Feel free to remix it, and do as you wish without reading walls of text.</p>

<p>cheers</p>

<p>A simple Bus Pirate v3 to AVR adapter. This was made to simplify wiring between the v3 Bus Pirate and an AVR ISP header. Tested with the <a href="http://www.johngineer.com/projects/bb313/">BB313</a>, and ATTiny4313/85s.</p>

<p>Add a 3 pin header and a jumper to power the target AVR from the Bus Pirate (for normal operation, programming, etc).</p>

<p>Check out the &ldquo;<em>Other work in this field</em>&rdquo; section below for other adapters as well (some of them support multiple protocols and programmers).</p>

<p>Grab a zip file of the entire repository by <a href="https://github.com/davidk/avrrrinator/archive/master.zip">clicking here</a>.</p>

<p>The .brd file is in the hardware/revA folder.</p>

<p>From there, you can generate
your own Gerber files using Eagle and send them off, or use a service which processes the Eagle board file for you.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t already have a preferred fabricator, please give <a href="http://oshpark.com/">OSHPark</a> a shot. OSHPark will take the .brd file, panel it and return your boards in a few weeks. It is also run by <a href="https://twitter.com/laen/">a very awesome person</a>.</p>

<p>See the &ldquo;<em>Bill of Materials</em>&rdquo; section for information on parts.</p>

<p>The silkscreen is really small in some areas. This will be changed in a future run. If making one for yourself, feel free to change the silkscreen text sizes around, and add a miniature dinosaur.</p>

<h4 id="headers-jumper:b0111992a47110b3acce8a55c388e8a7">Headers/Jumper</h4>

<p>These parts are from Mouser:</p>

<p><em>1x</em>: <strong>151-8033-E</strong> - Red jumper for power selection</p>

<p><em>1x</em>: <strong>517-9612066404AR</strong> - 6 pin ISP header</p>

<p><em>1x</em>: <strong>649-68004-236</strong> - Strip of header (enough for both the 10 pin Bus Pirate header and the 3 pin power select switch)</p>

<h4 id="cables:b0111992a47110b3acce8a55c388e8a7">Cables</h4>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t already have the necessary cables, pick these up. Both are needed since one connects to the Bus Pirate, and the other connects to the AVR:</p>

<p>These parts are from Adafruit:</p>

<p><em>1x</em>: <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/370">10-pin Socket/Socket IDC cable (6&rdquo;)</a></p>

<p><em>1x</em>: <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/371">6-pin Socket/Socket IDC cable (6&rdquo;)</a></p>

<p><em>1x</em>: <strong>538-90130-1110</strong> (Mouser) - BP box connector. This hasn&rsquo;t been tested or soldered in, but it appears to fit comfortably within the layout of the board.</p>
